Tab-ExtraRight
(not S+D anymore)
Shifts - without space/double function


20190912 - Tab is moved to ExtraRight layer.
The Tab key is just a layer switch only now.

20190916 - Placing TAB on QAZS in the EXtraRight layer - looking for the best location for that key.
The idea is to keep the fingers in the same position related to each other when TAB is pressed.
Otherwise it requires too manymoveemnts.
